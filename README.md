<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Enzo Daren B. Padual</h1>
<h3 align="center">As a prospective system administrator/network administrator, my enthusiasm for technology fuels my desire to comprehend and innovate within this field. Although my proficiency in Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials is currently at an amateur level, I have acquired valuable experience over the past two years of my course. During this time, I've gained hands-on knowledge in implementing both software and hardware systems, allowing me to successfully undertake projects that integrate these concepts. My commitment to continuous learning in technology remains steadfast, and I am determined to enhance my skills in system administration as I embrace new technological advancements.</h3>

📖 Learnings:
- Scripting and Automation play pivotal roles in system administration, addressing the challenge of repetitive and time-intensive tasks. System administrators frequently leverage scripting languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell to automate routine processes, enhancing overall efficiency in managing and maintaining systems.
- Network administration zeroes in on switching technologies and router operations essential for sustaining small-to-medium business networks. This encompasses the management of wireless local area networks (WLAN) along with a comprehensive understanding of security concepts to ensure the robust functioning and safeguarding of network infrastructures.**
