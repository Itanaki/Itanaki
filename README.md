# Hi üëã, I'm Enzo Daren B. Padual

As a prospective system administrator/network administrator, my enthusiasm for technology fuels my desire to comprehend and innovate within this field. Although my proficiency in Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials is currently at an amateur level, I have acquired valuable experience over the past two years of my course. During this time, I've gained hands-on knowledge in implementing both software and hardware systems, allowing me to successfully undertake projects that integrate these concepts. My commitment to continuous learning in technology remains steadfast, and I am determined to enhance my skills in system administration as I embrace new technological advancements.
